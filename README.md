# AC3.2-WildLifeSightings

**WildLifeSightings** is a subject-tracking app that utilizies Core Data to store meaningful, persistant mutable entries (including storing pointers to external images as binary data). 

This app mainly utilizes Core Location and Core Data to store client-side photos & information, which is fetched and displayed onto a mapView. 

The layout is done via storyboards and nibs and programmatically.

API's used:
- [Dark Skys Weather](https://darksky.net/dev/) (No Auth): A no-nonsense forecast API to attach current weather conditions to our Sighting entity.
- [Fieldbook](https://fieldbook.com/) (Basic Auth): While an object is saved into Core Data, a portion of the information can be POST'ed for external review.
- ~~[Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) (OAuth 1.1)~~: Requires HMAC-SHA1 client-side encoding, signature building, and very specific, ordered Header parameters. We will never speak of this again.
- ~~[Imgur API](https://api.imgur.com/) (No Auth OR OAuth 2.0)~~: Anon image uploading via Base64 encoding always ends up in a connection lost error. Attempts to convert Core Data binary data to JPG takes up way too much space.

CocoaPods used: 
- [SwiftSpinner](https://github.com/icanzilb/SwiftSpinner): During data-transfer sessions, a visually-appealing spinning icon appears to show the end-user that a process is underway.
- [ImagePicker](https://github.com/hyperoslo/ImagePicker): A UI pod that replaces the UIImagePickerController, it allows the user to take photos and/or choose gallery shots to append, simultaneously.

## Project Timeline and Methodology

The 3-day minimum viable product would allow the end-user to save persistent data, track location, and share to an online community. The tasks were delegated according to point value so team members could work independently beyond the inital planning stages (and to minimize conflicts). 

The agile-lite-alike method allowed all team members to work without overlap or requiring additional time to coordinate. By mid-day of Day 3, most features were implemented to viable standards; remaining time was spent to improve existing features and to extend the feature-set of the app within reason.
